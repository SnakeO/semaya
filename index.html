                    <p><span class="drop-cap">A</span> shocking investigation by The Bali Tribune has uncovered dangerous food safety violations at the supposedly five-star Semaya Beach Resort in Nusa Penida, where guests were served raw chicken disguised as rare beef, leading to severe illness and a systematic cover-up by management.</p>
                    
                    <p>The incident occurred when two guests ordered rare beef at the resort's restaurant. What arrived at their table was later confirmed by multiple independent sources to be raw chicken, not the premium steak they had ordered and paid for.</p>
                    
                    <div class="health-alert">
                        <h4>Health Warning</h4>
                        <p>Resort guests experienced severe gastrointestinal illness following consumption of improperly prepared meat. The resort refused to cover medical expenses for parasite testing.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <h3>Restaurant Manager's Deception</h3>
                    
                    <p>When guests complained about the suspicious meat, Restaurant Manager <span class="manager-name">Andika Putra</span> insisted multiple times that the raw, pink meat was indeed beef, dismissing their concerns as "a bad batch."</p>
                    
                    <div class="pull-quote">
                        "I will not be gaslighted into thinking I ate steak. I've been eating steak for 40 years."
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>The guests, suspicious of the meat's unusual texture and taste, sought verification from multiple independent sources. A professional chef friend immediately identified the meat as "definitely not steak" upon viewing photographs.</p>
                    
                    <p>Social media verification proved even more damning. When photos were posted to a specialized steak forum, dozens of users confirmed it was not beef. The poster was subsequently banned from the forum for sharing images of non-steak meat.</p>
                    
                    <div class="photo-container">

                    <h3>Management Cover-Up Exposed</h3>
                    
                    <p>Resort Operations Manager <span class="manager-name">Sindra Sindrawan</span> initially acknowledged the obvious truth, admitting the meat was "NOT beef" when shown photographic evidence. However, hours later, he reversed his position after consulting with staff.</p>
                    
                    <p>In a desperate attempt to maintain the deception, management cooked fresh beef in front of the guests, claiming it was identical to what had been served days earlier. The difference was immediately apparent - the fresh meat looked and tasted like actual beef.</p>

                    <h3>AI Analysis Confirms Deception</h3>
                    
                    <p>Modern technology provided the final proof. When photos of the freshly cooked meat were analyzed by ChatGPT, the AI immediately confirmed it was beef. However, when shown images of the original meal, the AI stated it "couldn't be beef due to the incorrect color and texture."</p>
                    
                    <p>The AI analysis noted that "chicken or pork would NEVER be served raw by a reputable resort," highlighting the severity of the food safety violation.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Medical Consequences Ignored</h3>
                    
                    <p>One guest developed severe stomach cramps the same evening, while another suffered serious gastrointestinal illness 48 hours later. Faced with uncertainty about whether they had consumed raw chicken or pork - each carrying different parasitic risks - the guests sought medical attention.</p>
                    
                    <p>The resort refused to pay for the medical visit, despite being directly responsible for serving the contaminated meat. Guests were forced to purchase anti-parasite medication and undergo stool testing at their own expense.</p>

                    <h3>Pattern of Negligence</h3>
                    
                    <p>The food safety violation appears to be part of a broader pattern of negligence at the resort. Guests reported yellow water from bathroom faucets, inadequate hot water supply, and dangerous bicycle rentals with faulty brakes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps most troubling, housekeeping staff were observed cleaning rooms while wearing outdoor shoes, tracking dirt and contamination into guest quarters - a basic hygiene violation that suggests systemic problems with health and safety protocols.</p>
                    
                    <h3>No Senior Management Available</h3>
                    
                    <p>When guests requested to speak with senior management about the food poisoning incident, none were available on-site. The only manager present was the same restaurant manager who had initially lied about the meat's identity.</p>
                    
                    <p>This absence of accountability during a health crisis raises serious questions about the resort's commitment to guest safety and proper management oversight.</p>
