            Plaintiff is a citizen and resident of the United States who was a paying guest at Defendants' resort facility from approximately [DATE] to [DATE], 2024.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>
            Defendant Semaya Beach Resort is an Indonesian corporation operating a hospitality business at Jl. Raya Batukandik, Nusa Penida, Klungkung Regency, Bali 80771, Indonesia, marketing itself as a premium five-star resort facility.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>
            Defendant Andika Putra is an individual who, at all times relevant herein, acted as Restaurant Manager for Defendant Semaya Beach Resort and was acting within the course and scope of his employment and/or agency relationship with said Defendant.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>
            Defendant Sindra Sindrawan is an individual who, at all times relevant herein, acted as Operations Manager for Defendant Semaya Beach Resort and was acting within the course and scope of his employment and/or agency relationship with said Defendant.

        <!-- Factual Background -->
        <div class="cause-header">Statement of Facts</div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>
            On or about [DATE], 2024, Plaintiff, relying on Defendants' representations that Semaya Beach Resort was a premium hospitality establishment, booked accommodations at said facility for multiple nights at a cost of approximately $[AMOUNT] per night.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">8.</span>
            Upon arrival, Defendants <span class="emphasis">immediately breached their duty of care</span> by failing to provide basic amenities standard in the hospitality industry, including complimentary drinking water, which is considered essential for guest health and safety, particularly in tropical climates.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">9.</span>
            When Plaintiff requested drinking water, Defendants attempted to charge the unconscionable sum of 160,000 Indonesian Rupees (approximately $10 USD) for two bottles of water, then subsequently replaced sealed, safe bottled water with unsanitary refillable containers of questionable origin and safety, as depicted in <span class="exhibit">Exhibit A</span> attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">10.</span>
            On or about [DATE], 2024, Plaintiff and his companion ordered rare beef at Defendants' restaurant facility. <span class="emphasis">Instead of the ordered beef, Defendants served Plaintiff raw chicken or other poultry</span>, creating an immediate and serious health hazard.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">11.</span>
            The meat served to Plaintiff was visibly and texturally inconsistent with beef, as demonstrated by the photographic evidence attached hereto as <span class="exhibit">Exhibit B</span> and <span class="exhibit">Exhibit C</span>.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">12.</span>
            When Plaintiff complained about the obviously incorrect and dangerous food service, Defendant Andika Putra <span class="emphasis">knowingly and willfully made false representations</span> to Plaintiff, insisting multiple times that the raw poultry was beef, despite clear evidence to the contrary.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">13.</span>
            Plaintiff, seeking independent verification of his observations, consulted with a professional chef who confirmed that the substance served was not beef, as evidenced by the communications attached hereto as <span class="exhibit">Exhibit D</span>.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">14.</span>
            Plaintiff further sought verification through online forums dedicated to steak identification, where multiple experts confirmed the served substance was not beef. Plaintiff was ultimately banned from said forum for posting images of non-beef products, as shown in <span class="exhibit">Exhibit E</span>.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">15.</span>
            As a direct and proximate result of consuming the contaminated raw poultry served by Defendants, Plaintiff and his companion suffered <span class="emphasis">severe gastrointestinal illness, stomach cramps, and other symptoms consistent with foodborne illness</span>.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">16.</span>
            Fearing parasitic infection from the unknown raw meat consumption, Plaintiff was forced to seek medical attention and consume anti-parasitic medications as a precautionary measure, as evidenced by <span class="exhibit">Exhibit F</span> and <span class="exhibit">Exhibit G</span> attached hereto.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">17.</span>
            Despite being directly responsible for the contaminated food service, <span class="emphasis">Defendants refused to pay for Plaintiff's necessary medical treatment</span>, adding insult to injury and demonstrating a callous disregard for guest welfare.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">18.</span>
            Defendant Sindra Sindrawan initially acknowledged to Plaintiff that the served substance was not beef, but later, under apparent pressure from other Defendants, <span class="emphasis">changed his story and participated in the cover-up</span> by falsely claiming the dangerous substance was beef.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">19.</span>
            To further deceive Plaintiff, Defendants showed packaging of actual beef as "proof" of what was served, despite clear evidence that the actual served product was entirely different, as shown in <span class="exhibit">Exhibit H</span>.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">20.</span>
            When challenged, Defendants cooked actual beef in their kitchen, which bore no resemblance to the raw poultry originally served to Plaintiff, as demonstrated by the comparative evidence in <span class="exhibit">Exhibit I</span>.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">21.</span>
            Artificial intelligence analysis confirmed Plaintiff's observations, identifying the properly cooked beef as genuine beef while determining that the original served substance could not be beef due to incorrect color and texture, as evidenced in <span class="exhibit">Exhibit J</span> and <span class="exhibit">Exhibit K</span>.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">22.</span>
            Defendants' facility contained numerous additional health and safety violations, including contaminated water systems producing yellow-colored water unfit for human consumption, as demonstrated in <span class="exhibit">Exhibit L</span> (video evidence).
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">23.</span>
            The accommodations featured inadequate bathroom facilities with no privacy and cross-contamination from cigarette smoke due to poor architectural design, creating additional health hazards as shown in <span class="exhibit">Exhibit M</span> and <span class="exhibit">Exhibit N</span>.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">24.</span>
            Defendants' housekeeping staff violated basic sanitation protocols by cleaning guest rooms while wearing outdoor footwear, thereby tracking external contaminants into supposedly clean accommodations, as evidenced in <span class="exhibit">Exhibit O</span>.
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <span class="paragraph-number">25.</span>
            Defendants provided dangerous and defective recreational equipment, including bicycles with defective brakes, flat tires, and broken components that posed serious safety risks to guests, as shown in <span class="exhibit">Exhibit P</span> and video evidence <span class="exhibit">Exhibit Q</span>.
