            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                When I arrived at Semaya Beach Resort, the location near Crystal Bay looked promising. But problems started immediately.
            </p>
            
            <h3>No Drinking Water Provided</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                After settling in, I looked for complimentary water bottles - standard in most hotels. There were none. I called the front desk to request some. They sent up two sealed bottles with a bill for <strong>160,000 Indonesian Rupees</strong> (approximately $10 USD).
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                When I complained about both the lack of complimentary water and the outrageous charge, management admitted they "should have" provided water in the room. But here's where it gets worse - they took away the sealed bottles I had ordered and replaced them with <strong>refillable containers</strong>.
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                In Indonesia, a 5-star resort should not be providing water in refillable, unsealed containers. Are the containers clean? Is the water properly filtered? Are the people handling it following proper hygiene protocols? All of these worries would be completely avoidable if they just provided complimentary sealed water in the first place, like every other 5-star resort does.
            </p>
            
            <img src="assets/images/refillable-water-bottle.jpg" alt="Refillable water bottles provided by resort" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Not the best start to a supposedly 5-star experience.

            <div class="critical">
                <strong>CRITICAL FOOD SAFETY VIOLATION:</strong> Raw chicken served instead of ordered rare beef

            <h3>The Night It Happened</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                My date and I ordered rare beef for dinner. What arrived at our table looked wrong from the start, but we only realized the full horror after taking a bite. The texture and flavor were completely unlike any beef we'd ever tasted.
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                When we complained, Restaurant Manager <span class="manager-name">Andika Putra</span> came to our table. Despite both of us arguing that this was clearly not steak, he insisted multiple times that it was beef. He claimed it was just "a bad batch" - as if that somehow made serving raw mystery meat acceptable.
            </p>
            
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">

            <h3>Seeking External Verification</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Doubting my own senses, I reached out to my friend who's a professional chef. Their response told me it definitely was not steak.
            </p>
            
            <div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; margin: 20px 0; flex-wrap: wrap;">

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                I posted the photo on a social media site that specializes in steak. Within hours, I received dozens of messages all confirming the same thing - this wasn't beef. The ultimate proof? I actually got BANNED from the forum because I posted a picture of non-steak, and they only allow steak photos!

                    <strong>Day 1 Morning:</strong> The next morning, I asked to speak with upper management about the incident. None were available. The only manager on site was the same restaurant manager who had lied to us the night before. What kind of "5-star" resort has no senior management present?

                    <strong>Days 1-2:</strong> Since we didn't know if it was raw chicken or pork, we found some anti-parasite medication and took it as a precaution. Each type of meat carries different parasitic or bacterial risks.

                    <strong>Day 3:</strong> Finally, I had an in-person meeting with Resort Operations Manager <span class="manager-name">Sindra Sindrawan</span>. He took one look at the photo and immediately agreed with me - it was NOT beef. He promised he would identify the meat and get back to me.

                    <strong>Day 3 (hours later):</strong> A few hours passed before our second meeting. Sindra sat down and, after "talking with the staff," now claimed it was beef. He showed me a photo of beef packaging as "proof." I said, "Fine, let's go to the kitchen right now and cook it up."

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                We went to the kitchen where management cooked up what they claimed was the same meat. This time, it looked and tasted exactly like beef - proper beef. Yet they still insisted this was identical to what they'd served me two days earlier.

            <h3>AI Analysis Proves the Truth</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Standing there in the kitchen, I opened ChatGPT and took a photo of the freshly cooked meat. The AI immediately confirmed it was definitely beef.
            </p>
            
            <img src="assets/images/chat-gpt-identifies-beef.jpg" alt="ChatGPT confirms the newly cooked meat is beef" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                I then uploaded the photo of my original meal from two days prior. ChatGPT initially thought it was Ahi Tuna. When I clarified it was meat, not fish, the AI concluded it couldn't be beef due to the incorrect color and texture. It added that chicken or pork would NEVER be served raw by a reputable resort.
            </p>
            
            <img src="assets/images/chat-gpt-identifies-not-beef.jpeg" alt="ChatGPT says original meal cannot be beef" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
            
            <h3>Medical Consequences & Resort's Refusal</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                I told them firmly: "I will not be gaslighted into thinking I ate steak. I've been eating steak for 40 years."
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                The meat was either chicken or pork, each carrying different health risks when consumed raw. Since I didn't know which it was, I had to visit a doctor for stool testing to check for parasites. The worst part? <strong>The resort refused to pay for the medical visit</strong>, even though they were the ones who served me raw meat.
            </p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>üöø Bathroom Conditions</h2>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                The bathroom problems started the moment I turned on the faucet. Yellow water came pouring out - not slightly discolored, but distinctly yellow.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                The shower was equally disappointing. The "hot" water was warm at best and ran out completely after about 15 minutes. I prefer long, relaxing showers on vacation - that was impossible here.
            </p>
            
            <h3>The Open-Air Nightmare</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                The toilet had an open-air design with zero sound privacy. This wouldn't normally be a huge issue, but when you're suffering from severe stomach problems after eating raw chicken, it becomes a nightmare. My neighbors could hear every embarrassing sound, and I could hear them conversing from my bathroom.
            </p>
            
            <img src="assets/images/open-air-bathroom.jpg" alt="Open-air bathroom with no privacy" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                To make matters worse, they placed smoking and non-smoking rooms directly next to each other. Thanks to the open-air design, cigarette smoke constantly wafted into our non-smoking room.
            </p>
            
            <img src="assets/images/smoking.jpg" alt="Neighbors smoking visible from non-smoking room" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">

            <h2>üßπ Housekeeping Standards</h2>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                The housekeeping staff, while friendly, had one major hygiene issue - they cleaned the rooms while wearing their outdoor shoes. 
            </p>
            
            <img src="assets/images/staff-with-shoes.jpg" alt="Housekeeping staff cleaning with outdoor shoes on" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;">
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Why would staff wear shoes inside while cleaning? These are the same shoes they wear outside, walking on streets and sidewalks. They then track all that dirt and contamination into our room while "cleaning" it. Basic hygiene standards completely ignored.

                The resort offered bicycle rentals, but the bikes were death traps. They were old with flat tires and broken kickstands that caused them to fall over constantly.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                The real danger came from the brakes - they squealed loudly and barely worked. No lights or helmets were provided, which is especially dangerous since the local roads have no lighting at night.

            <h2>‚úã Final Insult: The Broken Comb</h2>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Just before checking out, I used a wooden comb provided by the resort. It <strong>broke in half</strong>.
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Having spent time in Thailand, I knew this was a terrible omen. In Thai culture, a broken comb during use is a serious bad omen - a warning of misfortune. The superstition says it must be thrown away immediately or the bad luck will manifest.
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                This perfectly encapsulated the entire stay - even the resort's combs were cursed.

                <strong style="color: #92400e;">Cultural Note:</strong> In Thai tradition, when a comb breaks while brushing hair, it's considered a bad omen that brings misfortune if kept. The immediate disposal of the broken comb is believed to prevent bad luck from manifesting. This belief is part of Thailand's extensive superstition framework that governs daily life.
            </div>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-style: italic;">
                The resort couldn't even provide functioning combs or safe bicycles, let alone safe food, clean water, or adequate gym equipment.

                    The only saving grace is that the service staff were kind. This is a <strong>1-star resort as a direct result of 1-star management</strong>.

                    This resort represents everything wrong with hospitality management - prioritizing face-saving over guest safety, lying instead of taking responsibility, and operating with standards that wouldn't be acceptable at a roadside motel, let alone a resort claiming to offer a premium experience.
