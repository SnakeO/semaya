                        <p><strong>I need to share this before something happens to me. I've been getting strange calls since I left.</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>Three weeks ago, I booked what was supposed to be a luxury getaway at Semaya Beach Resort on Nusa Penida island in Bali. The location looked perfect - crystal clear waters, pristine beaches, five-star rating. What I experienced there... I'm not sure I'll ever be the same.</p>
                        
                        <p>This is going to be long. I have evidence. And I think other people need to know what's happening at this place.</p>

                        <h2>Day 1: The Arrival</h2>
                        
                        <p>The first red flag should have been the water. No, not the beautiful ocean water - I'm talking about the drinking water. Or lack thereof.</p>
                        
                        <p>I arrived around 3 PM, exhausted from the journey. The resort looked stunning from the outside - tropical paradise, exactly like the photos. But when I got to my room and looked for the complimentary water bottles that literally every decent hotel provides... nothing.</p>
                        
                        <p>I called the front desk. "Could I get some drinking water, please?"</p>
                        
                        <p>"Of course, sir. We'll send some right up."</p>
                        
                        <p>Twenty minutes later, a staff member arrived with two sealed water bottles and handed me a bill. 160,000 Indonesian Rupees. That's about $10 USD. For two bottles of water.</p>
                        
                        <p>When I complained, they admitted they "should have" provided water in the room. But here's where it gets weird - they took away the sealed bottles and replaced them with <span class="spoiler" onclick="this.classList.add('revealed')">refillable containers. In Indonesia. At a supposed 5-star resort.</span></p>
                        
                        <div class="creepy-text">
                            Who refills them? How clean are they? What's actually IN the water?<br>
                            I should have left then. I should have fucking left.

                        <h2>Day 1 Evening: The Dinner That Changed Everything</h2>
                        
                        <p>My girlfriend and I went to the resort restaurant around 7 PM. The atmosphere was nice enough - dim lighting, ocean views, the works. We both ordered rare beef steaks. We're not picky eaters, but we know our meat.</p>
                        
                        <p>What they brought to our table... I'm still having nightmares about it.</p>
                        
                        <div class="medical-warning">

                        <p>The texture was wrong. The color was wrong. The smell was... fuck, I can't describe the smell. It looked like raw meat, sure, but it wasn't beef. I've been eating steak for 40 years. This was something else entirely.</p>
                        
                        <p><img src="assets/images/rare-meat.jpg" alt="The meat they served us" class="evidence-img"></p>
                        
                        <p>We took one bite each. ONE BITE. That was enough.</p>
                        
                        <p>When we complained, the restaurant manager - I'll call him <span class="glitch-text" data-text="ANDIKA">ANDIKA</span> because fuck protecting his identity - came over. This guy looked me dead in the eye and insisted it was beef. INSISTED. Even when I showed him the photo, even when my girlfriend was gagging, even when we both told him this was clearly not steak.</p>
                        
                        <p>"It's just a bad batch," he said. A BAD BATCH. Like that makes serving raw mystery meat acceptable.</p>
                        
                        <div class="creepy-text">
                            Bad batch of WHAT, Andika?<br>
                            What animal did this come from?<br>
                            How long has it been dead?<br>
                            WHY WON'T YOU TELL US WHAT WE ATE?
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>That night, my girlfriend started getting stomach cramps. Severe ones. I thought it might just be anxiety from the weird dinner, but...</p>

                        <p>I just got off the phone with a chef friend of mine. I sent him the photos. His response:</p>
                        
                        <p><img src="assets/images/ask-chef-translated-eng.jpg" alt="Chef's horrified response" class="evidence-img"></p>
                        
                        <p>He's been working in restaurants for 15 years. He's never seen anything like it.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Day 2: The Gaslighting Begins</h2>
                        
                        <p>The next morning, I demanded to speak with upper management. You know what they told me? No senior management was available. None. At a 5-star resort. The only manager on site was the same lying piece of shit who had gaslighted us the night before.</p>
                        
                        <p>This is when I started getting paranoid. What kind of resort operates with no senior management? What are they hiding?</p>
                        
                        <p>Since we didn't know if we'd eaten contaminated chicken, pork, or something worse, we bought anti-parasite medication as a precaution. Different meats carry different risks when consumed raw.</p>

                            We were medicating ourselves against unknown parasites<br>

                            that they refused to identify<br>

                        <h2>Day 3: The Operations Manager's Confession</h2>
                        
                        <p>Finally, the Operations Manager agreed to meet with me. Let's call him Sindra. At first, he seemed different. Professional. Concerned.</p>
                        
                        <p>I showed him the photo of our "beef."</p>
                        
                        <p>His face went white. "This... this is not beef," he admitted immediately. "I will find out what meat this is and get back to you within hours."</p>
                        
                        <p>FINALLY. Someone was telling the truth.</p>
                        
                        <p>Or so I thought.</p>
                        
                        <p>Three hours later, same guy, same office. But something had changed. He sat down with a photo of beef packaging and claimed our mystery meat WAS beef after all. Someone had gotten to him. Someone made him change his story.</p>
                        
                        <p>"Fine," I said. "Let's go to the kitchen right now and cook up this 'beef.'"</p>
                        
                        <p>We did. And you know what? What they cooked looked and tasted exactly like proper beef. Perfect beef. Nothing like what they'd served us two days earlier.</p>

                        <p>I opened ChatGPT right there in the kitchen and had AI analyze both photos:</p>

                        <p>The AI was definitive: what we ate on day 1 was NOT beef. And reputable establishments would NEVER serve chicken or pork raw.</p>

                            They lied about it.<br>
                            They covered it up.<br>

                        <p>I posted the original photo on a steak subreddit. Got dozens of responses confirming it wasn't beef. Then I got BANNED from the forum for posting non-steak content. The moderator's message: "This is clearly not steak and doesn't belong here."</p>

                        <p>Even strangers on the internet can tell it's not beef. Why couldn't the resort staff?</p>
                        
                        <h2>The Other Horrors</h2>
                        
                        <p>The meat incident was just the beginning. This place is wrong in ways I'm still discovering.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The Water:</strong> Every faucet ran yellow. Not slightly discolored - YELLOW. I have video.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Bathroom:</strong> Open-air design with zero privacy. When you're suffering from food poisoning from mystery meat, having your neighbors hear every sound is psychological torture.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The Staff:</strong> Friendly, but they clean rooms while wearing outdoor shoes. The same shoes they walk around outside in. Think about that.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The "Safety" Equipment:</strong> They rent out death trap bicycles with broken brakes and no lights for night riding on unlit roads.</p>

                        <p>On our last morning, I used a wooden comb provided by the resort. It broke in half while I was using it.</p>
                        
                        <p><img src="assets/images/broken-comb.jpg" alt="The broken comb - a terrible omen" class="evidence-img"></p>
                        
                        <p>In Thai culture (I lived there for two years), a broken comb during use is one of the worst omens possible. It means death or serious misfortune is coming. The superstition says you must throw it away immediately or the curse will follow you.</p>
                        
                        <p>I threw it away. But I don't think it matters. I think the curse was already in motion the moment we ate whatever they served us.</p>
                        
                        <div class="medical-warning">
                            <strong>MEDICAL UPDATE:</strong> I had to see a doctor for stool testing to check for parasites. The resort refused to pay for it, even though they were responsible for serving contaminated meat. The results... I'll share them in Part 2 if I'm still alive to post it.

                        <p>Since leaving Bali, I've been getting calls from Indonesian numbers. Always the same pattern - phone rings twice, then hangs up. Sometimes I hear breathing. Once, I swear I heard someone whispering in Indonesian.</p>
                        
                        <p>I think they're monitoring people who complain about the resort. I think there's something bigger happening there.</p>

                        <p>Whatever they're serving isn't food. Whatever they're doing to cover it up isn't normal business practice. And whatever happened to make that comb break... I don't think it was an accident.</p>
                        
                        <div class="creepy-text">
                            The meat tasted like fear.<br>
                            The water ran the color of infection.<br>
                            The comb broke like a bone.<br>
                            And somewhere in Bali, they're still serving mystery meat to unsuspecting tourists.

                        <p>Part 2 coming soon, if I can stay safe long enough to post it.</p>

                        <p>OP, I'm a medical doctor specializing in tropical diseases and food-borne illnesses. What you've described is extremely concerning. The texture and color you're describing in that photo doesn't match any properly prepared beef I've seen in 20 years of practice.</p>
                        <p>Please get comprehensive stool testing done ASAP if you haven't already. Some parasites from improperly prepared meat can remain dormant for months before causing serious complications.</p>
                        <p>Also, document everything. This could be a public health issue affecting multiple tourists.</p>

                        <p>No legitimate restaurant would serve meat that looks like that and then refuse to identify it. Something is very, very wrong here.</p>

                        <p>Health inspector here. This is grounds for immediate closure in any country with proper food safety regulations. The fact that they:</p>

                        <p>2. Refused to identify what was served</p>
