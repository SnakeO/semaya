            <h2>üëã My Arrival</h2>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                When I arrived at Semaya Beach Resort, the location near Crystal Bay looked promising. But problems started immediately.
            </p>
            
            <h3>No Drinking Water Provided</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                After settling in, I looked for complimentary water bottles - standard in most hotels. There were none. I called the front desk to request some.
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                They sent up two sealed bottles with a bill for <strong>160,000 Indonesian Rupees</strong> (approximately $10 USD).
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                When I complained about the charge and lack of complimentary water, management admitted they "should have" provided water in the room. They then took away the sealed bottles I had ordered and replaced them with <strong>refillable water bottles</strong>.
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                In Indonesia, a 5-star resort should not be providing unsealed water in refillable containers. Are the containers clean? Is the water clean? Basic health and safety questions that shouldn't need to be asked.
            </p>

                Not the best start to a supposedly 5-star experience.

            <h2>‚úã Final Insult: The Broken Comb</h2>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Just before checking out, I used a wooden comb provided by the resort. It <strong>broke in half</strong>.
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Having spent time in Thailand, I knew this was a terrible omen. In Thai culture, a broken comb during use is a serious bad omen - a warning of misfortune. The superstition says it must be thrown away immediately or the bad luck will manifest.
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                This perfectly encapsulated the entire stay - even the resort's combs were cursed.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box" style="background: #fef3c7; border-color: #f59e0b;">
                <strong style="color: #92400e;">Cultural Note:</strong> In Thai tradition, when a comb breaks while brushing hair, it's considered a bad omen that brings misfortune if kept. The immediate disposal of the broken comb is believed to prevent bad luck from manifesting. This belief is part of Thailand's extensive superstition framework that governs daily life.
            </div>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-style: italic;">
                The resort couldn't even provide functioning combs, let alone safe food or clean water.

            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #dc2626; margin: 20px 0;">By the end, I couldn't wait to leave this 1-star joke of a resort.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #dc2626; margin-bottom: 15px;">The Real Problem: Management</h3>
                <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.8;">
                    The only saving grace is that the service staff were kind. This is a <strong>1-star resort as a direct result of 1-star management</strong>.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 15px;">
                    <strong>Management Failures:</strong><br>
                    ‚Ä¢ Restaurant Manager <span class="manager-name">Andika Putra</span> - Lied directly to guests about raw chicken<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ Operations Manager <span class="manager-name">Sindra Sindrawan</span> - Initially honest, then backtracked under pressure<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ No senior management available on-site during crisis<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ Attempted to gaslight guests about food safety incident<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ Zero accountability for health violations<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ Complete failure in basic hospitality standards
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: left; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 15px;">
                    This resort represents everything wrong with hospitality management - prioritizing face-saving over guest safety, lying instead of taking responsibility, and operating with standards that wouldn't be acceptable at a roadside motel, let alone a resort claiming to offer a premium experience.
